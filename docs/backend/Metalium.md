## Background

Tenstorrent produces a range of ASICs with very scalable design that enables efficient inference of AI models.

**Metalium and TTNN** is the default low level and operator library developed by Tenstorrent (analogous to CUDA and cuDNN + ATen). They are the critical part of executing neural network computation on Tenstorrent devices and provides high level primitives for scaling to multiple connected Tenstorrent processors.

### llama.cpp + Metalium

The llama.cpp Metalium backend is designed to support inference on Tenstorrent's Wormhole or later processors. It is experimental software in it's early days. The earlier Grayskull generation processors have their support removed from current versions of TTNN, thus also unsupported by this backend.

### Note on current limitations

As mentioned earlier, the Metalium backend is experimental software. Thus features will be developed and enabled over time. As of writing the documentation, the following limitations applies:

* Only device 0 is used
* No device clustering support
* KV Cache has to be stored on the CPU (via the `-nkvo` flag)
* FP32 is emulated by internally using BFP16
   * Native FP32 will be enabled for Wormhole soon

### Dependencies

TBD. I don't have a formal list of what is needed for now. But either install from your system's package manager or build from source.

### Building and using the backend

There is no "supported" TTNN versions Metalium and TTNN is still a moving target. Instead, need and support for newer versions of TTNN is constantly updated in order to utilize new features and take in bug fixes. However, generally build the latest Metalium and TTNN from the [official repostory](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal) by following the steps

1. Setup you environment/driver following the [official guide](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/INSTALLING.md)
  * As of writing, the official guide still references an old `ARCH_NAME` variable. Which is no longer needed
2. Build Metalium (and TTNN) with GCC (DO NOT use clang, they link against libc++ if clang is detected)


```bash
cd /path/to/your/tt-metal
export TT_METAL_HOME=`pwd`
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd` -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja
ninja

# Installs to the build directory
ninja install
```

3. Build llama.cpp with `GGML_METALIUM=ON`. It will read the `TT_METAL_HOME` variable above and error if not  detected. Likewise, the backend needs the environmental variables to function.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/llama.cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DGGML_METALIUM=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j16
```

4. Tenstorrent devices are treated as a GPU in llama.cpp. Use `-ngl` to set number of layers offloaded.

**NOTE:** add the `-nkvo` flag to stop the KV cache being offloaded

```bash
bin/llama-cli -ngl 23 -m tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q4_0.gguf -p "The solution to Riemann hypothesis is" -nkvo
```

## Hardware

### Hardware support

The following hardware ate tested

| Tenstorrent Device            | Status  |
|:-----------------------------:|:-------:|
| Wormhole N300                 | Tested  |

## DataType Supports

Besides the standard FP32 and BFP16 floating point support. Tenstorrent processors support their own native quantized data types (BFLOAT8_B, BFLOAT4_B, etc.). Thus, weights and activations are automatically converted to supported native types. The conversion is as follows:

| GGML Type             | Metalium DataType          |

## Environment Variable

### Runtime variables

| Variable Name | Value                                | Description                                                          |

### Debug flags

There are several debug flags available to assist with debugging/performance of the backend. These flags are triggered by setting environment variables and will be removed eventually.

| Variable Name                    | Value           | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GGML_METALIUM_PRINT_REJECTED_OPS | 0(default) or 1 | Print operators GGML asked if the Metalium backend can run, and Metalium reported false                                                                                  |
| GGML_METALIUM_PRINT_VIEW         | 0(default) or 1 | Print all view operations (VIEW, TRANSPOSE, RESHAPE, PERMUTE) that Metalium's lazy view system sees                                                                      |
| GGML_METALIUM_CACHE_MM_TRANSPOSE | 0(default) or 1 | TTNN has limited support for pre-transposed matmul that GGML needs and does most on the fly. This options cache the transpose. Trades lot of memory for some performance |
